GRAPHIC LICENSE
The day and night earth images of the Default theme are from NASA's "Blue Marble
2002" image collection:
http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view_set.php?categoryID=2364

The night image has been altered to better match by overlaying, blending, and
color-matching missing ice from the day image.  These modifications are not
considered to be substantial, and are therefore ineligible for copyright.

NASA Terms of Use

For all non-private uses, NASA's Terms Of Use are as follows:

   1. The imagery is free of licensing fees
   2. NASA requires that they be provided a credit as the owners of the imagery

Visible Earth Addendum

Beyond the NASA Terms, the Visible Earth team requests, but does not require:

   1. The Visible Earth be provided a credit as the location that the imagery
      was found at
   2. A URL be provided, either to the Visible Earth
      (http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/) or to the page providing the link to the
      used image.

Other images, such as backgrounds in Vector and other themes, are distributed
under the same license as other data files. See DATA LICENSE section for details

FONT LICENSES
The boxy font used is "Acknowledge", by Brian Kent, modified in order to have
the numbers fixed-width and to register the correct height in pygame.

-----
